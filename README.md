### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm a data scientist (my current proficient language is Python), and I especially like:
* exploring data to find new insights
* deploying APIs
* tuning models to meet accuracy levels

You can drop me a line at my Twitter account (@eli__fulton), my LinkedIn (Eli Fulton), or just email me (eli@elifulton.com).
